HackerTracker allows users to track their productivity across  
multiple platforms and view data in a digestible manner.

### Desktop Client
Our Java powered desktop client allows the user to personally track time  
spent on certain programs. The program will self-report to the database.

### Chrome Extension
The HT Chrome Extension tracks time spent on websites.  
Coming soon: The user has the option to designate certain websites as  
unproductive and others as productive.

### Website
On HackerTracker.me, users can view the time spent on various programs  
and websites in a digestible format. Users can view trends and see  
if most of their time is spent productively or otherwise.

### Backend
Backend is powered by AWS and coca cola/ donuts
